INTRO

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) occurs when photons are resonantly absorbed and emitted by transitions between different energy levels of a nucleus in a magnetic field.

The goals of this experiment are to explore basic NMR methods, measure the magnetic moment of the proton, and to use NMR to probe the environment of the protons in materials.

THEORY

Many nuclei have a non-zero spin angular momentum, I, and consequently a nuclear dipole moment, µ. For a particle of mass m and charge q, we can write
µ = γ I= g q/mI
where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and g is the “g-factor”. A classical rotating object of any shape has g=1 as long as its charge and mass have the same distribution. For a spin ½ quantum point particle, g=2 (plus small corrections).

    NUCLEAR MAGNETIC MOMENT: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_moment

    The nuclear magnetic moment is the magnetic moment of an atomic nucleus and arises from the spin of the protons and neutrons. It is mainly a magnetic dipole moment.

    The nuclear magnetic moment varies from isotope to isotope of an element. For a nucleus of which the numbers of protons and of neutrons are both even in its ground state (i.e. lowest energy state), the nuclear spin and magnetic moment are both always zero. In cases with odd numbers of either or both protons and neutrons, the nucleus often has nonzero spin and magnetic moment.

The interaction of magnetic dipoles with a static magnetic field gives rise to a series of energy levels. The energy differences are small, typically corresponding to radio frequencies (e.g. 42.58 MHz for protons in a 1 Tesla magnetic field), and an appropriate r.f. (radio frequency) field will induce magnetic dipole transitions between the different states. - find proper rf to induce dipole transitions

    RESONANCE CONDIITON

    The interaction energy of a magnetic moment, µ with a constant external magnetic Bo is E = -µ.Bo = -γI.Bo

    This experiment studies hydrogen nuclei (protons) which have spin I = ½, so in a magnetic field Bo = B(^z), spin eigenstates are proton spin up and proton spin down with energies E↑ = 1/2 γ(hbar)Bo and E↓ = -1/2 γ(hbar)Bo

    Photons can be resonantly absorbed or emitted when h(nu)=ΔE=γ(hbar)Bo

    ωo = ν/2π = γBo is known as the Larmor frequency

    TRANSIITONS

    The spontaneous emission rate for a magnetic dipole transition to a lower energy state is A21 = (16*π^3*ν^3*µ^2)/(3*εo*h*c) This depends on the third power of the frequency, and at radio frequencies is too small to be significant. For example, an isolated proton in a 0.75T magnetic field has a spontaneous emission lifetime of 2×10^17 years – longer than the age of the universe.

    Protons in NMR samples are, however, not isolated. Coherent spontanious radiation increases the emission rate by hν/kT. The protons are also enclosed in a coil which provides a further enhancement of Qλ3/V, where Q is the quality factor of the coil’s resonant circuit, λ is the NMR wavelength, and V is the volume.

    A 1 milliwatt, 30 MHz generator can produce about 1022 photons per second in the resonant range Δν.

    POPULATION DYNAMICS

    Initially, the spin system will be in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings (called the “Lattice”), so the populations of the nuclear energy levels will be proportional to the Boltzmann factor e^(−E/kT).

    This net absorption of r.f. energy will tend to equalize the populations of the different energy levels. Simultaneously, various relaxation mechanisms tend to maintain thermal equilibrium by the exchange of energy between the spin system and the lattice.

    MEANING OF π/2 AND π PULSES

    An r.f. pulse at the Lamor frequency will induce transitions between ↑ and ↓ states, producing a mixed state spinz = α↑ + β↓

    A π/2 pulse is an r.f. pulse with an amplitude and duration that will transform an initial ↑ state into the symmetric state spinz(π/2) = 1/sqrt(2)( ↑ + ↓ ) Classically, this corresponds to rotating the magnetic moments into the x-y plane, i.e. a 90° or π/2 rotation into transverse magnetization. These classical moments will now precess (rotate direction) in the x-y plane at the Larmor frequency. Ideally, the duration ∆t of a π/2 pulse is related to the r.f. pulse magnetic field (Brf) by the Larmor condition, i.e. ∆t = 4/((nu)orf) = 8π/(γBrf)

11:35 - Prof Visit, quick checkin. Reccomendation: go through the old lab document to get some general NMR theory, then start running through the stuff on this specific setup after that to try and get the reccommended exercises for this setup.

    Similarly a pulse of the same amplitude but twice as long will reverse the longitudinal magnetization, i.e. transform an initial ↑ state into a final ↓ state. This is called a π pulse, since classically it corresponds to rotating the magnetic moments by 180°.
